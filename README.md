# Web3 Prep

Repository for prepping for an intensive Web3 bootcamp: tools, fundamentals, exercises, and notes.

## Goals
- Build comfort with Linux/WSL, Git/GitHub, and VS Code
- Solidify JavaScript, frontend, backend, blockchain fundamentals
- Practice Solidity and smart contract development

## Folder structure
- 00-notes: Concept notes and reflections  
- 01-javascript: JavaScript fundamentals and exercises  
- 02-web: HTML, CSS, frontend
 basics  
- 03-backend: Servers, APIs, data flow  
- 04-blockchain: Bitcoin, Ethereum, nodes, architecture  
- 05-solidity: Smart contracts and Solidity practice

## Quick setup
1. Install WSL (Windows) or use native Linux/macOS.  
2. Install VS Code and the Remote - WSL extension (if using WSL).  
3. Install Node.js and npm.  
4. Configure Git:
    - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    - git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
5. Clone:
    - git clone <repo-url>
    - code . (opens project in VS Code)

## Workflow
- Use feature branches: git checkout -b feat/<topic>
- Commit often with concise messages
- Open PRs and add notes to 00-notes for retrospective learning

## Weekly plan (example)
- Week 0: Tooling, environment, basic Git & JS refresh  
- Week 1: JavaScript deep dive + small projects  
- Week 2: Frontend fundamentals and DOM projects  
- Week 3: Backend basics, REST APIs  
- Week 4: Blockchain concepts and local nodes  
- Week 5+: Solidity practice, audits, and deployments

## Notes
- Keep README updated with commands, links, and milestones.
- Add study logs and key takeaways to 00-notes.

## License
Add a license file if needed (MIT recommended for learning repos).
